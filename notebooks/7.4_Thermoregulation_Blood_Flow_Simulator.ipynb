    "## PART 1: THE PATTERN HUNTER'S BRIEFING\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Climate Control Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "From Chapter 7.5:\n",
    "> \"Vertebrate circulatory systems serve as sophisticated climate control networks, \n",
    "> using blood flow patterns, vessel dilation and constriction, and specialized \n",
    "> heat exchange mechanisms to maintain optimal body temperatures.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Thermoregulatory Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heat Conservation (Cold Environments):**\n",
    "- Vasoconstriction: Reduce blood flow to skin/extremities\n",
    "- Counter-current heat exchange: Warm returning blood with arterial heat\n",
    "- Regional heat retention: Keep vital organs warm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heat Dissipation (Hot Environments):**\n",
    "- Vasodilation: Increase blood flow to skin surfaces\n",
    "- Thermal windows: Use ears, flippers as heat radiators\n",
    "- Panting circulation: Enhanced respiratory blood flow\n",
    "- Evaporative cooling: Support sweating/panting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Questions:\n",
    "1. How does counter-current exchange prevent heat loss?\n",
    "2. Why are elephant ears such effective radiators?\n",
    "3. How do tuna keep their muscles warm in cold water?\n",
    "4. What allows penguins to survive Antarctic winters?\n",
    "5. How does high altitude affect blood oxygen transport?"
